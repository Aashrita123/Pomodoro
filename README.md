The Pomodoro App helps you boost productivity by using the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working in focused 25-minute intervals followed by 5-minute breaks. 
This app is simple to use: start a timer, get reminders for breaks, and track your progress. Customize your work and break durations to fit your needs
and stay on top of your tasks efficiently. For setup, clone the repository, install dependencies with npm install, and start the app with npm start.
